# Regex My Email

A Regular Expression (Regex) tutorial for matching an email

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll be covering the regex components used to verify a user's provided email. The following regex is a simple and common one used for matching an email to ensure its validity:
<br><code> /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ </code></br>
Depending on how strict you want your email validation process to be, the regex needed for matching an email will differ. We'll go over what each character and symbol does with a quick and simple description.

## Regex Components
A regex is considered a literal, so the pattern must be wrapped in forward facing slash characters `/`. As you'll notice, our regex example that matches an email has an opening and closing forward `/` for this very reason.
<br><code> /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ </code></br>
